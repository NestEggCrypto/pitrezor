### Quick start guide:
## List of required components:

1. A raspberry pi zero. You don't need the pi zero W, it cost probably a little bit more than the regular pi zero, but it will work anyway. The difference is that pi zero W has wifi and bluetooth but this project don't use it. The network drivers are not loaded by the platform so the W can be considered as secure.
2. An SD card. The image to write on the SD card is very small (around 50 Megs) so virtually any decent SD card should work. Make sure you have one that is compatible with the pi.
3. A good micro-usb to usb cable.
4. A mini HDMI male to HDMI female adapter to verify the output via the HDMI output. You need HDMI cable and a TV or monitor too!
5. Two push buttons (normally open contact, SPST)
6. Some wires to solder the buttons to the pi zero

7. Optionally, an I2C or SPI OLED display. Supported OLED are based on the SH1106 controller or Adafruit controller.
8. Optionally, a box or enclosure for a more professional look.

You will also need standard tool like solder iron, pliers...

Of course, If you are using the Adafruit bonnet, you don't need separate push buttons or OLED. Refer to Adafruit documentation about how to connect the bonnet to the pi zero.
